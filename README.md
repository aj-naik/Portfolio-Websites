# Portfolio-Websites
Portfolio websites made using just HTML, CSS, Javascript.

Portfolio 1 is meant as a portfolio for a company/brand. This was my Web design course project. Embedded Google Forms and Php for backend in this website. It is a full fledged working site.

Portfolio 2 is a personal portfolio website which I used as my portfolio for a while.

Made both websites by following youtube tutorials with quite a few features/additions and modifications of my own.
